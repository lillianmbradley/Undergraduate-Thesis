# **Optimizing Defensive Positioning for Columbia University Baseball Based on Batter-Pitcher Handedness**

This repository contains the code, write-up, plots, and images used for my Undergraduate Thesis for the Columbia University Computer Science Department. The project focuses on optimizing defensive positioning for Columbia University Baseball using TrackMan data and machine learning techniques. The goal is to maximize outs based on batter-pitcher handedness matchups.

The predictive model was developed using XGBoost and TrackMan's statistical data, with a particular focus on batter and pitcher handedness, infield shifts, and player positions (X, Z coordinates). The model provides actionable insights into how fielding positions can be dynamically adjusted to increase the likelihood of converting balls in play into outs.

Advised by Dr. Andrew J. Blumberg of Columbia University's Computer Science and Mathematics Departments.
